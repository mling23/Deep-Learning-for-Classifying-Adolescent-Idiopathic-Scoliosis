# Deep-Learning-for-Classifying-Adolescent-Idiopathic-Scoliosis
Research Project created in collaboration with Northwestern University during the summer of 2022 in the Mechanistic Data Science program. 
Convolutional neural network for classifying a coronal x-ray into one of the Lenke Classification System's curve types.
Thank you to my advisor Chanwook Park and the rest of the Northwestern University Mechanistic Data Science team as well as the Lurie's Children Hospital for the dataset!
